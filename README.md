# vhost.sh

## Project description
A bash script to automate and simplify the Creaton of Apache virtual hosts on Linux systems. 


## Installation And Usage
To be able to use this program, simply clone this repository to your local system. Switch (`cd`) into the cloned repository (_vhost.sh_) and start the program by running `bash vhost.sh` on your terminal.
To simplify things, you can create an alias in your _bash.aliases_ file and call up the script from any where within your system by simply invoking the alias.

**Note:**
- The script is configured to recognise only domain names ending in `.com`, `.org`, and `.edu` as valid domain names.
- you can always modify this script as needed, to suit your individualised purposes.

I do not expect that you will encounter any probelms whatsoever while running this script. in case you do, please do well to submit a pull request, explaining the bugs/probelms encountered.

I hope this program makes life easier for you. 
Thank you and bye.
